        <h2>Java Script history</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1996:</b> Changed from LiveScript to JavaScript to attach Java developers. <b> JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java.</b></li>
            <li><b>1997:</b> ECMAScript 1 became the first version of the JavaScript language standard:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>ECMAScript: The language standard;</li>
                  <li>JavaScript: The language in practice.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>2009:</b> ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was released with lots of new features.</li>
         <li><b>2015:</b> ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015) was released: <b>the biggest update ever.</b></li>
            <li><b>2016:</b> ECMAScript 2016 (ES2016) was released with minor changes only.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> JavaScript today:</h2>
        <h3>ES5</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fully supported in all modern browserss</li>
            <li>Ready to be used today (2016)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>ES6/ES2015</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Only partial support in modern browsers, no support in older browsers</li>
                <li>Can't use it in production today(2016)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>ES2016</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Almost no support in modern browsers</li>
                <li>Can't use it in production today (2016)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Browsers support for ES2015 &amp; ES2016 is not good nowadays</p>

    <h2>Why are using ES5 in this course?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The browsers haven't adapted to ECMAScript 2015 and still has very incomplete browser support today.</li>
            <li>Almost all tutorials and code you find on the web today is still in ES3</li>
            <li>When working on older codebases, these will be written in ES5</li>
            <li>It's easier to learn ES5 and then upgrade to ES6/ES2015</li>
        </ul>
